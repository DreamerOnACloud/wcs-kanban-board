# ðŸ“‹ Project Specification

## Overview

A lightweight, Trello-style Kanban board where users can create lists (columns), add cards (tasks), and drag cards between lists. Built entirely with vanilla web components.

## Project Goals

### Primary Objectives

- Practice encapsulated, reusable web components
- Learn state management across components without frameworks
- Exercise drag-and-drop interactions and persistence
- Build a portfolio-ready project that's recognizable and useful

### Technical Constraints

- Pure Web Components (Custom Elements + Shadow DOM)
- CSS custom properties for easy theming
- Persistence via `localStorage`
- Modular structure: each list and card is its own web component

## Feature Specifications

### Core Features (MVP)

1. **List Management**
   - Add new lists
   - Remove lists
   - Lists maintain their own state
   - Default titles with fallbacks

2. **Card Management**
   - Add cards to lists
   - Edit card titles and content
   - Remove cards from lists
   - Cards are draggable elements

3. **Drag and Drop**
   - Drag cards between lists
   - Visual feedback during drag
   - Smooth animations
   - State updates on successful drop

4. **Data Persistence**
   - Save board state to `localStorage`
   - Load state on page refresh
   - Handle state conflicts

### Stretch Goals

1. **Card Details Modal**
   - Rich text description
   - Due date field
   - Tag/label system
   - Custom fields

2. **List Features**
   - Drag-and-drop reordering
   - List collapse/expand
   - List limits (min/max cards)

3. **Data Management**
   - Export board as JSON
   - Import from JSON
   - Data validation

4. **Theming**
   - Light/dark mode toggle
   - Custom color schemes
   - Responsive design

## Component Architecture

### `<wcs-kanban-board>`

- Manages local state
- Handles card additions/removals
- Drop target for cards

### `<wcs-kanban-card>`

Card component:

- Displays task information
- Manages edit state
- Implements drag functionality
- Self-contained styling

### `<wcs-kanban-modal>`

Modal component:
